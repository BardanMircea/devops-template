# DevOps Template Repository

## Purpose

This repository serves as a template for setting up and managing DevOps pipelines and infrastructure. It provides a standardized structure and reusable components to streamline development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes.

## Components

   - Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.
   - Ansible playbooks for configuration management.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines:**

   - Pre-configured workflows for GitHub Actions.
   - YAML templates for Jenkins and Azure DevOps.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**

   - Prometheus and Grafana configurations.
   - Log aggregation setup using ELK stack.

4. **Containerization:**

   - Dockerfiles for application packaging.
   - Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

5. **Security:**
   - Static code analysis tools integration.
   - Secrets management using HashiCorp Vault.
